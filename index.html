    <p>The 'cat' is a small pet animal. It has four short legs and a beautiful furry tail.
        Its body is covered with soft and silky hairs. Its claws and teeth are sharp.
        It has bright and greyish eyes. It can see even in the darkness. </p>
    <p>
        The cat is found all over the world. It is a beautiful small animal resembling the likes of a
        <a href="#">tiger</a>.
        It lives on the streets as well as in our houses.
        Cats can be shy in nature and can even take time while adjusting with the environment.
        One needs to be patient and deal with the animal with a lot of love and care.
